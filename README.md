## Installation
1. **Clone the repository or download the code files.**
2. **Open the code in Google Colab or any other Python environment that supports Jupyter notebooks.**
3. **Ensure the following Python packages are installed:**

    ```sh
    pip install numpy pandas geneticalgorithm tabulate
    ```

## Usage

### Upload the Excel File
The script expects an Excel file containing energy data. Upload the file when prompted in Google Colab.

### Run the Code
Execute the cells in the notebook to perform energy management calculations, optimize the system parameters, and decode the results.

## Energy Management
The energy management function processes the input data and computes various metrics to handle energy generation, storage, and evacuation efficiently.

## Optimization with Genetic Algorithm
The optimization function uses a genetic algorithm to find the optimal values for wind capacity, solar capacity, and battery state of charge.

## Decoding the Results
After obtaining the optimal values from the genetic algorithm, the results are decoded and analyzed. This involves calculating various metrics such as correlation, penalties, and overall costs.

### Correlation Calculation
Computes the correlation between different energy values.

### Penalty Calculation
Calculates penalties based on deviation from desired DFR values.

### Result Interpretation
Interprets the optimal results and calculates relevant metrics such as total cost and penalty.
